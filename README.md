# HackShack

This is a repo to hold my hack shack designs and notes in case someone else wants to use them.

The design is inspired by the [Vipp Shelter](https://www.vipp.com/en/shelter/the-vipp-shelter/the-vipp-shelter/). But instead of all manufactured steel the materials will try to be commonly accessible dimensional lumber.

## Foundation

Concrete piers should be at least 12 inches below undisturbed soil;

> Ground Snow load = 0, Wind Design/Speed (mph) = 85, Wind Design/Topographic Effects = No, Seismic Design Category = D2, Subject To Damage From/Weathering = Negligible, Subject To Damage From/*Frost line depth* = 12 inches below undisturbed soil, Subject To Damage From/Termite = Very Heavy, Winter Design Temp = 40 degrees Fahrenheit, Ice Barrier Underlayment Required = No, Flood Hazards = FIRM 3/2/2006 (Panels 219D, 238D, 329D, 331D, 332D, 333D, 334D, 351D), Air Freezing Index = 0, Mean Annual Temp = 55 degrees Fahrenheit. -[Santa Cruz Municipal Code](http://www.codepublishing.com/CA/SantaCruz/) (search for 'frost')
