# HackShack

This is a repo to hold my hack shack designs and notes in case someone else wants to use them.

The design is inspired by the [Vipp Shelter](https://www.vipp.com/en/shelter/the-vipp-shelter/the-vipp-shelter/). But instead of all manufactured steel the materials will be mostly accessible dimensional lumber.

## Fireplace

Wood burning fireplace insert like [this one](http://www.lopistoves.com/product-detail.aspx?model=420#inst-tab)

- zero clearance means it can be built with far less space from combustible materials
- Fireplace insert dimensions: 19" high * 27" wide * 14" deep
