# HackShack

This is a repo to hold my hack shack designs and notes in case someone else wants to use them.

The design is inspired by the [Vipp Shelter](https://www.vipp.com/en/shelter/the-vipp-shelter/the-vipp-shelter/). But instead of all manufactured steel the materials will be mostly accessible dimensional lumber.
